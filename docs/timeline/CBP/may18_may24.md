## Goals

This is mostly a learning week. In my original proposal, I thought that the coding period would begin this week. Since I have another two weeks, I'm going to focus on developing a good base.

* Incorporate Friday's feedback into GUI layout sketches.
* Read more closely into the visNetwork package, potentially post an issue on the GitHub repo.
* Learn more about Plotly and Shiny.

## Log/notes (meta)

05/17: A new week! Focused on learning more about Plotly. Started a datacamp course that seems helpful, keeping track of progress [in a GitHub repo](https://github.com/julianstanley/intermediate-interactive-dataviz-plotly). Tomorrow: think more about this week's goals, and then learn more!
