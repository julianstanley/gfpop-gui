## Goals

This is mostly a learning week. In my original proposal, I thought that the coding period would begin this week. Since I have another two weeks, I'm going to focus on developing a good base.

* Incorporate Friday's feedback into GUI layout sketches.
* Read more closely into the visNetwork package, potentially post an issue on the GitHub repo.
* Learn more about Plotly and Shiny.

## Log/notes (meta)

05/18:

* While taking the datacamp course: the [`crosstalk` package](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) is probably what I need to link the changepoint plot to the graph plot.
