## Goals

This is mostly a learning week. In my original proposal, I thought that the coding period would begin this week. Since I have another two weeks, I'm going to focus on developing a good base.

* Incorporate Friday's feedback into GUI layout sketches.
* Read more closely into the visNetwork package, potentially post an issue on the GitHub repo.
* Learn more about Plotly and Shiny.

## Revised sketches

For more information, see [issue #3](https://github.com/julianstanley/gfpop-gui/issues/3).

Just needed to revise the analysis tab:

## visNetwork reading

For more information, see [issue #2](https://github.com/julianstanley/gfpop-gui/issues/2).

I've made some progress on visNetwork. I'm now able to record changes to the visNetwork graph, based on [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54846529/how-to-extract-and-save-visnetwork-manipulation-changes-in-shiny),

## Plotly and Shiny Reading

Mostly focused on Plotly, namely following an intermediate course on datacamp. The course helped me a lot in getting more comfortable with plotly syntax and client-side interactivity. My notes [are here](https://github.com/julianstanley/intermediate-interactive-dataviz-plotly).

## Log/notes (meta)

No need for day-by-day updates this week. Lots of reading and notetaking, but nothing especially noteworthy.

I'm also moving some of this commentary to the "issues" tab of the main repository, even though I will keep documenting progress here. This progress log may evolve into more of a blog, unsure.

Note to self: on May 24th, post on the RStudio community forum asking for help picking a tool to make the constraint graph visualization. The folks over there seem exceptionally helpful.
