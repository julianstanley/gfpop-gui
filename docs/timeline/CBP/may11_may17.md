Goals:

* (Carry-over from last week): app layout sketch, itemized checklist of features we want in the app.
* Read the gfpop paper and package documentation in more detail, and make sure to write down questions to ask Guillem and Toby in meeting on Friday.
* Think about setting up coding environment: make notes about how you are going to do that, review those with Guillem and Toby on Friday, and then implement them on Saturday.
