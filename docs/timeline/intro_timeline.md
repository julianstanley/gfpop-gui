Hi! I will update this section of the website as I progress through Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020. It will include my goals and progress for each week in the program, as well as notes about any observations or surprises.

In my GSOC application, I mentioned keeping a log of my progress in a "progress.md" file. This webpage will hopefully serve as a more easily-accessible version of that idea.
