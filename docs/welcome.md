Thanks for visiting! I'm [Julian Stanley](https://www.julianstanley.com) and I've made this site as a place to record some documentation and weekly progress on my 2020 Google Summer of Code (GSOC) Project, which involes making a graphical user interface (GUI) for the [`gfpop` R package](https://github.com/vrunge/gfpop).

If you want to learn more information about the gfpop gui itself, a good place to start is the README in the [gfpopgui repo](https://www.github.com/julianstanley/gfpopgui), or the [application website itself](https://julianstanley.shinyapps.io/gfpopgui).

If you want more insight about the GSOC project or the details on the implementation of the gfpop gui application, then you're in the right place.

Each week during the project, I wrote a quick blog post about what features I worked on and roadblocks I hit along the way. You can find those in the [project timeline](timeline/intro_timeline).

I also consolidated some of those lessons into more organized tutorials. You can find those in the [tutorials section](tutorials/intro_tutorials).
