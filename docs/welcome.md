Thanks for stopping by. I will be keeping this website up-to-date as I progress through my Summer 2020 "Google Summer of Code" project, creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the `gfpop` R package.

It's still very early days for the project so, for now, this website just contains the [project timeline](timeline/intro_timeline), which is essentially a week-to-week blog of my progress.
