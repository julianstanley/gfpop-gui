<h4>How many changepoints? And, how should those changepoints 
                    be distributed?
</h4>
By default, they are evently spaced. However, modifying 'e' below 
will lead to (n) logarithmically-spaced changepoints, as follows:

<code style='text-align:center;'> 
seq_unnorm <- seq(0, 1, length_out = n+1)^e
            <br> 
relative_changepoint_loc <- (seq_unnorm / max(seq(unnorm))[2:length(seq_unnorm)]
